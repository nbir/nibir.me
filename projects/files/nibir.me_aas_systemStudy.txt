The listed program is a prototype model of a College
admission system, which nowadays is governed
electronically. It contains all features from a student
filling up the form, to allotment of seat.

There are two types of users here, Administrator and
Student. The administrator requires a password to login.
After successful login, he can create Examination centers
with all related details. He can also enter the branch
details.

The student can register himself by filling up a
form. He is given a roll number at the time of
registering.

The administrator then allots examination centers for
the registered candidates (an automated process), based on
availability of their chosen center. He also manually
enters the rank for each candidate.

The candidate can login with his roll number and
email, to check his center alloted and rank. He can also
login to appear for councelling, where he has to choose
his branch preferences. Further, he can check the branch
alloted to him.

The administrator allots branch to the candidates,
according to their rank(an automated process). He can also
view student information, either for a specific student,
or for all students at the same time. Further he can view
the center and branch status.
